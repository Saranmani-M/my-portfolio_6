  title: "Secure Cloud Storage System",
  subtitle: "Using Homomorphic Encryption",
  year: "2025",

    "https://images.pexels.com/photos/37730211/pexels-photo-37730211.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940",
  problem:
    "Organisations storing sensitive data in the cloud face a constant tension between accessibility and confidentiality. Conventional encryption protects data at rest, but the moment processing is required the information must be decrypted — exposing it to the cloud provider and any compromise in transit.",
  solution:
    "A privacy-preserving multi-tenant storage layer where computation happens directly on encrypted data. Files are encrypted client-side using homomorphic schemes, allowing arithmetic and search operations on ciphertext without ever revealing the underlying plaintext to the server.",
  architecture: [
    "Client SDK in Python — key generation, encryption, lattice-based operations",
    "Object storage layer — encrypted blobs with metadata isolation per tenant",
    "Compute proxy — performs additions and multiplications on ciphertexts",
    "Audit trail — append-only log of access and operations",
  ],
  technologies: ["Python", "Homomorphic Encryption", "Cloud Storage", "Linux"],
  outcome:
    "Awarded 2nd Prize at CYBERNIX '25 Project Expo at Vel Tech. Demonstrated end-to-end encrypted analytics on a 50MB simulated dataset with no plaintext exposure on the server.",
